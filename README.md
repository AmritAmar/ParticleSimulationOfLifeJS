# ParticleSimulationOfLifeJS
A JS implementation of theories by biologist Lynn Margulis. We simulate a particle universe to explore how life-like but artificial behavior emerges from simple rules.

# Exploring the emergence of life-like behavior from particle systems

This is a JS implementation of a particle system. The project simulates particles in a 'box' and assigns random forces between different types of particles. Interestingly, certain behaviors arise that are 'life-like' from these rules. The particles interact with each other arising in behaviors that mimic cell behavior. 

I was inspired by this from an Evolution Class I took at Cornell where I read the theories of biologist Lynn Margulis. I was further inspired to create my own implementation from Jeffrey Ventrella's [Clusters](http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/), which has examples in both the browser and in augmented reality. Furthermore, I also drew inspiration from [this study](http://zool33.uni-graz.at/artlife/PPS) and [HackerPoet](https://github.com/HackerPoet/) and his [Particle-Life Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_zmZ23grXE). The main idea, from [Lynn Margulis](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_24) is that all organisms naturally gravitate to other kinds of organisms, and likewise are repelled by different organisms. These particles experience attractions and repulsions with other particles of different colors. They cluster into social pods, or scatter and flee, often mimicking biological behaviors. Clusters shapeshift and exchange parts of their identities, much like the tiny organisms that came together in early evolution to form symbiotic unions.
